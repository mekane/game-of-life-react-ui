# Game of Life

* Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
* Run `npm serve` to just see the app.
* Run `npm start` to have babel watch in the background and run the server.

This was just supposed to be a throw-away code kata to implement the Game of Life rules using TDD. I did that but then 
I wanted to see the results graphically. So I built a simple web ui in React, using my own hacky, home-brewed Flux app
state management. But undo is free!
